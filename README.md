EAPS Purdue Portable Sensor Lab 2021 Arduino Nano

This is code written for the Purdue EAPS Portable Sensor Lab. It is designed to allow arbitrary command execution from the Raspberry Pi Zero W via I2C to any attached device. This allows the Pi to communicate with SDI-12, I2C, UART, and Analog sensors. It was written for the Arduino Nano using PlatformIO.
